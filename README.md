# Poetic Justice

An web app built for GSVLabs that is made to generate poems given a users input

## Description

This web app is built using Vue.js (took some time to learn but I think I got the hang of it), Vuex (State management), Node (Backend), and Sqlite (Database)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Buit in Mac OS X 10.14.6 using VScode v1.36.1
Testing using latest versions of Safari and Google Chrome
Node Package Manager v6.9.0


### Installing

Assuming you are using VScode open the project within a workspace.
Open the client and server directories in separate terminal windows
Run an npm install on both in order to catch all dependancies

### Executing program

Run an npm start for both client and server
```
host:client user$ npm start
```

## Help

I didnt get a chance to implement a cookie function to save state so by default if you refresh the page you will get a blank component wrapped by the toolbar. Just click "log in" or "poetic justice" to get back to the splash screen. You will have to relog in.
